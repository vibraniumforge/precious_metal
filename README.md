# PreciousMetal
My precious metal gem allows the user to download the prices of the 4 precious metals, which are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. The prices are given in U.S. dollars.

It uses Nokogiri to scrape a website. The information is then captured. The user is presented with a command line prompt. The user can view the price of any of the 4 metals. They can repeat the prompt. Or they can exit.

## Installation

"git clone" from this git hub address.
cd into the "precious_metal" directory.
enter "ruby bin/precious-metal" to start the app.
